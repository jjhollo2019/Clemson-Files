/* The release() function returns a valid block to the appropriate bitmap
 * or free list. The function performs several sanity checks on the memory
 * address passed by the caller, including alignment and a simple range
 * check. If the address passes those checks, a pointer to the header
 * (i.e., the start of the block) is constructed and the signature in
 * the header of checked. These sanity checks can use this code:
 */

void release( char *release_ptr ) {

  char *ptr;
  long long unsigned int header, *header_ptr;

  if( (long long int) release_ptr & 0x7 ){
    printf( "pointer not aligned on 8B boundary in release() function\n" );
    printf( "  => no action taken\n" );
    return;
  }
  if( ( release_ptr < min_address ) || ( release_ptr > max_address )  ){
    printf( "pointer out of range in release() function\n" );
    printf( "  => no action taken\n" );
    return;
  }
  ptr = release_ptr - 8;
  header_ptr = (long long unsigned int *) ptr;
  header = *header_ptr;

/* The allocate() function finds a free block that matches the requested
 * size in number of bytes. (A byte is equal to the 8-bit char data type
 * in C, so char* pointers are used.)
 *
 * The function determines the arena with the appropriate blocksize that
 * will accommodate the requested size plus 8 extra bytes for the header.
 * The bitmap or free list of an arena is based on the starting address
 * of free blocks, but the allocate() function inserts a header in an
 * allocated block and returns a pointer that is just beyond the header.
 * Thus, if the free block that is selected starts at address 0x1000,
 * the function inserts the header at address 0x1000 and sends back the
 * address 0x1008 to the caller.
 *
 * The bitmap for arena 0 is indexed in a big-endian manner in each
 * 32-bit word in an array of bitmap words (i.e., from left-to-right).
 * So 0x8000000 in word 0 of the bitmap represents the first block in
 * arena 0, and 0x0001000 in word 2 of the bitmap represents block 79
 * (i.e., 2*32 + 15) in arena 0. A 0 in the bitmap indicates that the
 * block is free, and a 1 indicates that the block is allocated. Free
 * blocks in arena 0 are totally empty (i.e., they do not contain
 * pointers or status bits).
 *
 * For arena 0, the free block with the lowest address, if one is
 * present, should be the one allocated.
 *
 * The other two arenas each use the initial bytes of free blocks to
 * hold the next-block pointers to implement singly-linked free lists.
 * Thus free blocks in arenas 1 and 2 are not completely empty.
 *
 * For arenas 1 and 2, the free block at the head of the free list, if
 * one is present, should be the one allocated.
 *
 * Each allocated block has an 8-byte header that contains a 7-hex-digit
 * signature and a single-hex-digit index of the arena to which the
 * block belongs. The index will help the release() function identify
 * the appropriate arena. The header values are:
 * 
 * 0xab51ead0 => arena 0
 * 0xab51ead1 => arena 1
 * 0xab51ead2 => arena 2
 *
 * If the arena corresponding to the request size has no free blocks,
 * the allocate() function returns a NULL pointer. Also, if the function
 * is called with a size that is non-positive or that is too large to
 * fit within the largest blocksize, the function returns a NULL pointer.
 *
 * Note that, unlike some other popular memory allocation techniques,
 * if a particular arena is fully allocated, there is no splitting or
 * coalescing of block from other arenas and no system calls to obtain
 * more blocks.
 *
 * My allocate() function uses helper functions and looks like this:
