Lab 04 - Pointers

Task 1:
------
1.  Record your output when you traced the code.
    42 42
    7 42
    8 7 8 8
    235 8 7 235 235


2.  Copy and paste the output generated when you compiled and
    executed ptrlab.c.
    42 42    
    7 42
    8 7 8 8
    235 8 7 235 235

3.  The values in 1 and 2 above should be the same.  DO NOT
    change your answers for 1.  For each answer that is different,
    explain why you think your answer is different.
    

Task 2:
------
Yes
Changing the value caused the answer to change at [0][1], [3][0], & [3][2] 
The first change is obvious since it is a direct change to that specific value.
The second change makes the pointer reference the value at c instead of a, so
  when the value of 235 is assigned to the address of c it doesn't change a.
The third change is because the value of c now holds 235 through the pointer assignment

The code would result in an error because *v is also a pointer because it needs and address
to point to and not a pointer to an address, it should be equal to the value of t.

Fix: int *v = t;
