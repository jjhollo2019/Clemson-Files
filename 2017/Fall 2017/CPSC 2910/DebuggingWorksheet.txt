Debugging Worksheet

Student Name:	Jeremy Holloway

1. What do you observe when you run the program? The program either crashed or gave incorrect answers

2. Where (what line numbers) have you set the breakpoints? 34, 56, 64, 68

3. What is the value of the named constant MIN_FAHRENHEIT and the variable tempScaleStr displayed in the Variables window? 

	MIN_FAHRENHEIT: -459.67
	
	tempScaleStr:	no value

4. Answer the following questions:

  a) Does the first if statement display the error message correctly? Yes
  b) What is the problem? The greater/less than symbols are backwards 
  c) How would you fix the program so it terminates when the user enters a Fahrenheit temperature less than the possible minimum temperature?
	Change the greater than operator to less than
5. Answer the following questions:

  a) Is the condition of the second if statement correct? No
  b) How will you change it? The formulas are in correct and one of the variables is incorrectly placed

6. What is the value of the expression you just selected in the Watch window? 95

7. Answer the following questions:

  a) Does the program compute the correct temperature in Rankine degrees?  In Reamur degrees? No, No
  b) Does the program assign the correct value for the variable tempScaleStr? Yes
  c) How can you modify the program to compute this equivalence properly?
	Correct the formulas, replace the variable in the rankine formula, and correct the temp scale label for the reaumer formula
